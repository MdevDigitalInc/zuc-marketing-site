      |Your privacy is our number one concern and that is why Smarter Home Control is end-to-end encrypted using private encryption keys unique to your installation. When you connect to Smarter Home Control at home or on the go, all communication between your multigateway and your Zucora Home app is protected from third parties - including us, the providers of the system. That is just the way we like it!
